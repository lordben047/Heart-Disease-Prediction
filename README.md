# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, I used Machine Learning to predict whether a person is suffering from a heart disease. The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. After importing the data, I analyzed it using plots. Then, I did generated dummy variables for categorical features and scaled other features. I then applied four Machine Learning algorithms, K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. I varied parameters across each model to improve their scores. In the end, K Neighbors Classifier achieved the highest score of 87% with 8 nearest neighbors.
